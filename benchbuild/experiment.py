"""Experiments

An experiment in benchbuild is a simple list of actions that need to be
executed on every project that is part of the experiment.
Every `callable` can serve as an action.

However, benchbuild provides many predefined actions that can
be reused by implementations in the `benchbuild.utils.actions` module.
Furthermore, if you do not need to control the default order of
actions for a run-time or a compile-time experiment you can reuse the
`Experiment.default_runtime_actions` or
`Experiment.default_compiletime_actions`.

Besides the list of actions, it is also the responsibility of an experiment
to configure each single project that should take part in an experiment.
This includes setting appropriate `CFLAGS`, `LDFLAGS` and any additional
metadata that has to be added to binary runs for later evaluation.

Example
-------
```python
class HelloExperiment(Experiment):
    pass
```
