"""
The 'polly-openmp-vectorize' Experiment.

This experiment applies polly's transformations with openmp code generation
enabled to all projects and measures the runtime.

This forms the baseline numbers for the other experiments.

Measurements
------------

3 Metrics are generated during this experiment:
    time.user_s - The time spent in user space in seconds (aka virtual time)
    time.system_s - The time spent in kernel space in seconds (aka system time)
    time.real_s - The time spent overall in seconds (aka Wall clock)
