"""
Helper functions for dealing with compiler replacement.

This provides a few key functions to deal with varying/measuring the compilers
used inside the benchbuild study.
From a high-level view, there are 2 interesting functions:
    * lt_clang(cflags, ldflags, func)
    * lt_clang_cxx(cflags, ldflags, func)

These generate a wrapped clang/clang++ in the current working directory and
hide the given cflags/ldflags from the calling build system. Both will
give you a working plumbum command and call a python script that redirects
to the real clang/clang++ given the additional cflags&ldflags.

The wrapper-script generated for both functions can be found inside:
    * wrap_cc()

Are just convencience methods that can be used when interacting with the
configured llvm/clang source directories.
