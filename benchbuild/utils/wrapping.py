"""
Wrapper utilities for benchbuild.

This module provides methods to wrap binaries with extensions that are
pickled alongside the original binary.
In place of the original binary a new python module is generated that
loads the pickle and redirects the program call with all its arguments
to it. This allows interception of arbitrary programs for experimentation.

Examples:
    TODO

Compiler Wrappers:
    The compiler wrappers substitute the compiler call with a script that
    produces the expected output from the original compiler call first.
    Afterwards the pickle is loaded and the original call is forwarded to the
    pickle. This way the user is not obligated to produce valid output during
    his own experiment.

Runtime Wrappers:
    These directly forward the binary call to the pickle without any execution
    of the binary. We cannot guarantee that repeated execution is valid,
    therefore, we let the user decide what the program should do.
