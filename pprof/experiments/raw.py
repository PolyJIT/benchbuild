"""
The 'raw' Experiment.

This experiment is the basic experiment in the pprof study. It simply runs
all projects after compiling it with -O3. The binaries are wrapped
with the time command and results are written to the database.

This forms the baseline numbers for the other experiments.

Measurements
------------

3 Metrics are generated during this experiment:
    time.user_s - The time spent in user space in seconds (aka virtual time)
    time.system_s - The time spent in kernel space in seconds (aka system time)
    time.real_s - The time spent overall in seconds (aka Wall clock)

    Run the given binary wrapped with time.

    Args:
        project: The pprof project that has called us.
        experiment: The pprof experiment which we operate under.
        config: The pprof configuration we are running with.
        jobs: The number of cores we are allowed to use. This may differ
            from the actual amount of available cores, obey it.
            We should enforce this from the outside. However, at the moment we
            do not do this.
        run_f: The file we want to execute.
        args: List of arguments that should be passed to the wrapped binary.
        **kwargs: Dictionary with our keyword args. We support the following
            entries:

            project_name: The real name of our project. This might not
                be the same as the configured project name, if we got wrapped
                with ::pprof.project.wrap_dynamic
            has_stdin: Signals whether we should take care of stdin.
